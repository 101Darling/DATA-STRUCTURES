'''
This program prompts the user for an integer n, tells
the user to think of a number between 0 and n âˆ’ 1, then makes guesses
as to what the number is. After each guess, the program must ask the
user if the number is lower, higher, or correct. Implement the
divide-and-conquer algorithm. In particular, you should round
up when the middle of your range is in between two integers. (For exam-
ple, if your range is 0 to 31, you should guess 16 and not 15, but if your
range is 0 to 30 you should certainly guess 15).
