# DATA-STRUCTURES
Data structures are crucial to the study of algorithms and in modern software engineering, data engi- neering and data science. The vast quantity of data available today demands efficient structures for storing,  reading, updating, and manipulating this data. This repo will express the basic tools to handle large amounts of data efficiently, for use in algorithms or otherwise.
